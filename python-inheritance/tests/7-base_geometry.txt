How to Use 7-base_geometry.py
=============================

This module defines a base class called BaseGeometry.

Instantiation
=============

BaseGeometry has no attributes.
So it is created without any arguments.

Example:

    BaseGeometry = __import__('7-base_geometry').BaseGeometry
    bg = BaseGeometry()
    type(bg)

Result:

    <class '7-base_geometry.BaseGeometry'>

If you try to create it with arguments, it will raise a TypeError.

Methods
=======

BaseGeometry has two methods:

1) area(self)

This method is not implemented.
If you call it, it raises:

    Exception: area() is not implemented


2) integer_validator(self, name, value)

This method checks the value.

- name: name of the variable
- value: value to check

If value is not an integer:
    TypeError: <name> must be an integer

If value is less than or equal to 0:
    ValueError: <name> must be greater than 0

If value is a valid integer and greater than 0:
    The method does nothing.

Both name and value must be given.
Otherwise, Python raises TypeError.
